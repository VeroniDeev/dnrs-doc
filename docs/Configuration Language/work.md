# How does it work

## Basic configuration

```dnrs
domain = "zoubheir.com"
ip = "128.0.2.1"
ttl = 3600
type = A
```

Here we have a basic configuration for our domain name.

Let's describe what's really going on behind the scenes:

- **domain:** the domain name we wish to configure
- **ip:** server ip adress
- **ttl:** the ttl we wish to configure with numeric values
- **type:** a type of pointing to our server

and that's not all, you can add even more variables for your domain name.
